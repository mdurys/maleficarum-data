# Change Log
This is the Maleficarum Data component. It carries data structures used by maleficarum projects. This only defines generic structures - no storage dependencies.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-03-20
### Added
- Replaced direct _meta calls in AbstractModel with a call to getMeta() getter method.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-03-20
### Added
- This is an initial release of the component - based on the code written by me and included inside the maleficarum API repository.
